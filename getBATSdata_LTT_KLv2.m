%Set up to calculate Ruth's derived variables from all BATS cruises (e.g.,
%MLD, season, and VZ); starting with BATS cruise #1
%based on Ruth's prior code : create_biosscope_files_2022_2023.m
% Original code from Ruth Curry, BIOS / ASU
% Krista Longnecker; 8 February 2024
% Krista Longnecker; 21 June 2024
%Modify existing MATLAB code to get the BV data from all time at BATS;
%using MATLAB because Ruth made these calculations in MATLAB

%Krista Longnecker ; 4 April 2025 (turn off Dropbox syncing while running
%this : will massively speed up the code)
